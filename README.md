# footballfantasy
This football fantasy game is a single-page application built with Vue.js and TailwindCSS. It allows users to create their own teams, draft players, and compete against other users in a season-long league. The game is currently in development.

Here are some of the features of the game:

    Create your own team and draft players from a pool of real-world football players.
    Compete against other users in a season-long league.
    Track your team's performance and see how you stack up against the competition.
    Earn points for your players' real-world performances.
    Win prizes for finishing in the top spots in the league.

The game is still under development.

Here are some of the benefits of using Vue.js and TailwindCSS for this project:

    Vue.js is a powerful and versatile JavaScript framework that makes it easy to build complex single-page applications.
    TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style your application with minimal markup.
    Both Vue.js and TailwindCSS are well-documented and have large communities of developers who can provide support.
